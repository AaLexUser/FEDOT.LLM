Each dataset can be grouped and labeled depending on their matching qualities under only one category. This makes the categories mutually exclusive. Types of categorical data: 1. Nominal data\\nThis is also called naming data. This type names or labels the data, and its characteristics are similar to a noun. Example: person’s name, gender, school name.2. Ordinal data\\nThis includes data or elements of data that are ranked, ordered, or used on a rating scale. You can count and order ordinal data, but it doesn’t allow you to measure it.Example: seminar attendants are asked to rate their seminar experience on a scale of 1-5. Against each number, there will be options that will rate their satisfaction, such as “very good, good, average, bad, and very bad.”Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form. Often referred to as quantitative data, numerical data is collected in number form and stands different from any form of number data type due to its ability to be statistically and arithmetically calculated.Types of numerical data1. Discrete dataDiscrete data is used to represent countable items. It can take both numerical and categorical forms and group them into a list. This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

A process called matching is done to draw out the similarities or relations between the data and then grouped accordingly.The data collected in the categorical form is also known as qualitative data. Each dataset can be grouped and labeled depending on their matching qualities under only one category. This makes the categories mutually exclusive. Types of categorical data: 1. Nominal data\\nThis is also called naming data. This type names or labels the data, and its characteristics are similar to a noun. Example: person’s name, gender, school name.2. Ordinal data\\nThis includes data or elements of data that are ranked, ordered, or used on a rating scale. You can count and order ordinal data, but it doesn’t allow you to measure it.Example: seminar attendants are asked to rate their seminar experience on a scale of 1-5. Against each number, there will be options that will rate their satisfaction, such as “very good, good, average, bad, and very bad.”Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form. Often referred to as quantitative data, numerical data is collected in number form and stands different from any form of number data type due to its ability to be statistically and arithmetically calculated.Types of numerical data1. Discrete dataDiscrete data is used to represent countable items. It can take both numerical and categorical forms and group them into a list. This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

Ordinal data\\nThis includes data or elements of data that are ranked, ordered, or used on a rating scale. You can count and order ordinal data, but it doesn’t allow you to measure it.Example: seminar attendants are asked to rate their seminar experience on a scale of 1-5. Against each number, there will be options that will rate their satisfaction, such as “very good, good, average, bad, and very bad.”Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form. Often referred to as quantitative data, numerical data is collected in number form and stands different from any form of number data type due to its ability to be statistically and arithmetically calculated.Types of numerical data1. Discrete dataDiscrete data is used to represent countable items. It can take both numerical and categorical forms and group them into a list. This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status. The data has been split into two sets: a training set (train.csv) with 891 passengers where the outcome (survival or not) is known, and a test set (test.csv) with 418 unseen passengers where the outcome needs to be predicted based on patterns found in the training set. Column name: Embarked Column description: A column indicating the port of embarkation for each passenger, with possible values 'S' (Southampton), 'C' (Cherbourg), and 'Q' (Queenstown). Column unique ratio: 0.0 (number of unique values divided by the number of total values) Column data:\\n```\\n| Embarked   |\\n|:-----------|\\n| S          |\\n| C          |\\n| Q          |\\n| nan        |\\n```\"\n",

A process called matching is done to draw out the similarities or relations between the data and then grouped accordingly.The data collected in the categorical form is also known as qualitative data. Each dataset can be grouped and labeled depending on their matching qualities under only one category. This makes the categories mutually exclusive. Types of categorical data: 1. Nominal data\\nThis is also called naming data. This type names or labels the data, and its characteristics are similar to a noun. Example: person’s name, gender, school name.2. Ordinal data\\nThis includes data or elements of data that are ranked, ordered, or used on a rating scale. You can count and order ordinal data, but it doesn’t allow you to measure it.Example: seminar attendants are asked to rate their seminar experience on a scale of 1-5. Against each number, there will be options that will rate their satisfaction, such as “very good, good, average, bad, and very bad.”Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form. Often referred to as quantitative data, numerical data is collected in number form and stands different from any form of number data type due to its ability to be statistically and arithmetically calculated.Types of numerical data1. Discrete dataDiscrete data is used to represent countable items. It can take both numerical and categorical forms and group them into a list. This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

Each dataset can be grouped and labeled depending on their matching qualities under only one category. This makes the categories mutually exclusive. Types of categorical data: 1. Nominal data\\nThis is also called naming data. This type names or labels the data, and its characteristics are similar to a noun. Example: person’s name, gender, school name.2. Ordinal data\\nThis includes data or elements of data that are ranked, ordered, or used on a rating scale. You can count and order ordinal data, but it doesn’t allow you to measure it.Example: seminar attendants are asked to rate their seminar experience on a scale of 1-5. Against each number, there will be options that will rate their satisfaction, such as “very good, good, average, bad, and very bad.”Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form.

A process called matching is done to draw out the similarities or relations between the data and then grouped accordingly.The data collected in the categorical form is also known as qualitative data. Each dataset can be grouped and labeled depending on their matching qualities under only one category. This makes the categories mutually exclusive. Types of categorical data: 1. Nominal data\\nThis is also called naming data. This type names or labels the data, and its characteristics are similar to a noun. Example: person’s name, gender, school name.2. Ordinal data\\nThis includes data or elements of data that are ranked, ordered, or used on a rating scale. You can count and order ordinal data, but it doesn’t allow you to measure it.Example: seminar attendants are asked to rate their seminar experience on a scale of 1-5. Against each number, there will be options that will rate their satisfaction, such as “very good, good, average, bad, and very bad.”Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form. Often referred to as quantitative data, numerical data is collected in number form and stands different from any form of number data type due to its ability to be statistically and arithmetically calculated.Types of numerical data1. Discrete dataDiscrete data is used to represent countable items. It can take both numerical and categorical forms and group them into a list. This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

You can count and order ordinal data, but it doesn’t allow you to measure it.Example: seminar attendants are asked to rate their seminar experience on a scale of 1-5. Against each number, there will be options that will rate their satisfaction, such as “very good, good, average, bad, and very bad.”Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form. Often referred to as quantitative data, numerical data is collected in number form and stands different from any form of number data type due to its ability to be statistically and arithmetically calculated.Types of numerical data1. Discrete dataDiscrete data is used to represent countable items. It can take both numerical and categorical forms and group them into a list. This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

A process called matching is done to draw out the similarities or relations between the data and then grouped accordingly.The data collected in the categorical form is also known as qualitative data. Each dataset can be grouped and labeled depending on their matching qualities under only one category. This makes the categories mutually exclusive. Types of categorical data: 1. Nominal data\\nThis is also called naming data. This type names or labels the data, and its characteristics are similar to a noun. Example: person’s name, gender, school name.2. Ordinal data\\nThis includes data or elements of data that are ranked, ordered, or used on a rating scale. You can count and order ordinal data, but it doesn’t allow you to measure it.Example: seminar attendants are asked to rate their seminar experience on a scale of 1-5. Against each number, there will be options that will rate their satisfaction, such as “very good, good, average, bad, and very bad.”Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form. Often referred to as quantitative data, numerical data is collected in number form and stands different from any form of number data type due to its ability to be statistically and arithmetically calculated.Types of numerical data1. Discrete dataDiscrete data is used to represent countable items. It can take both numerical and categorical forms and group them into a list. This list can be finite or infinite, too.Discrete data takes countable numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. In the case of infinity, these numbers will keep going on. Example: counting sugar cubes from a jar is finite countable. But counting sugar cubes from all over the world is infinitely countable.2. Continuous dataAs the name says, this form has data in the form of intervals. Or simply said ranges. Continuous numerical data represent measurements; their intervals fall on a number line. Hence, it doesn’t involve taking counts of the items. Interval data – interval data type refers to data that can be measured only along a scale at equal distances from each other. The numerical values in this data type can only undergo add and subtract operations. For example, body temperature can be measured in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, and neither of them can be 0.Ratio data – unlike interval data, ratio data has zero points. Similar to interval data, zero points are the only difference they have. For example, in the body temperature, the zero point temperature can be measured in Kelvin.\\nHuman: Dataset Title: Titanic Dataset Dataset description: Here is a short description of this dataset:\\n\\nThis dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.
